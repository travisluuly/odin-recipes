    <img src="https://www.fussfreecooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/a36.jpg" alt="Cooked Shinramun, topped with corn and scallions">
    <p>Packaged ramen: the <strong>staple</strong> food item for college students around the world. While not that nutritious, it is so easy to make and requires little to no effort. Follow this recipe to make "gourmet" ramen with the addition of our boiled egg.</p>
    
    <h1>Time</h1>
    <p>10 minutes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Packaged ramen (we will use Shin Ramen brand)</li>
        <li>Scallion</li>
        <li>Kimchi</li>
        <li>A boiled egg</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start a pot of boiling water. The pot should have just a little bit more water than needed for a bowl of broth</li>
        <li>Start to unpackage your ramen, taking out the seasoning and topping packets</li>
        <li>Once your water is at a rolling boil, add the contents of the packaged ramen: the dry noodles and seasoning packets. The ramen should remain cooking for 3-5 minutes, depending on how well done you want your noodles</li>
        <li>While you wait for your ramen to cook, feel free to slice your <a href="boil-egg.html">boiled egg</a> in half, and slice your scallion into fine pieces</li>
        <li>Once your noodles are cooked to your liking, move your noodles to a bowl and pour in the broth. Then, add the halves of the egg into your bowl, and top with your scallions and kimchi</li>
    </ol>
