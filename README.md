# odin-recipes
Recipes project in The Odin Project's' Foundations pathway

This project includes building a basic recipes website which has a main page that links to a few other pages. Each teaches the user how to make one food item. 

Completion of this project will require HTML knowledge to build webpages, which includes being able to start each html file with a boilerplate, organizing content into ordered/unordered lists, paragraphs, headers, and images, and finally linking the webpages together.
